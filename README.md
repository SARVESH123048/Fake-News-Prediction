# 📰 Fake News Detection using NLP & Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to detect whether a news article is **real** or **fake** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. It uses a labeled dataset from Kaggle and implements models like **Logistic Regression**, **Naive Bayes**, and **LSTM**.
